# hello-word
This repository is for my IFT 220 class that I am taking at ASU.

Hi, Fallen05 here! I enjoy learning about Github. I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology and I love learning everything I can about coding, unix, and how computers work in general. I love hiking, spending time with my wife and family, the outdoors, and just going out and learning something I didnt know before.
